# Opera-House-Tenant-Union

The Opera House Tenants Union formed in December 2018 as a group of concerned residents who came together as students and teachers…

As workers—disabled and abled, unpaid and paid, as nurses, artists, performers, writers, educators, activists, musicians, filmmakers, actors, advocates, and most importantly neighbors—to unite against tenant harassment and evictions and to ensure our building is a safe and stable ground from which our community can thrive and grow.

We represent over 32 homes in our 66-unit building and like countless members, accomplices, and allies we have been fighting against aggressive and negligent landlords to improve our living conditions and strive for housing justice in our community.

The admitted business models of big landlords contribute directly to housing unaffordability, financial insecurity, displacement, and homelessness in our community. 

By inflating rental prices for intentionally unmaintained, fast to flip, serial short-term housing stock while using tactics such as nonrenewal-of-lease evictions--big landlords are functioning to drive vulnerable, most often BIPOC, disabled, and/ or elderly tenants from their homes.

When the pandemic began our landlords refused to work with us and struggling neighbors. We knew that we needed immediate legal support and to quickly get organized in order to stand a chance in a fight against ruthless millionaires. We have since worked consistently to strengthen the architecture, clarity of goals, & growth of our Union. We make decisions collectively and our interests serve the intentions of the community.

We combine our resources and are strategically employing collective-purchasing and bargaining in defense of a multi-demand legal offensive against every tenant in our building our landlords filed in May of 2020. The suit has accompanied harassment and intimidation of many hues and has been hard but we have been much stronger together than any one of us would have been fighting alone. We are still at risk financially, legally, and of losing our homes but we have gained some ground and are not giving up the fight. 

We demand that we be treated with the basic human dignity every single person deserves; We refuse to continue to be put in danger and exploited. 

We seek a safe, dignified, stable healthy home and community now and for generations to come. 

We seek to contribute long-term to the well-being of our neighbors and neighborhood when and in the ways we are invited to. 

We fight in solidarity with all who struggle to have a home.
